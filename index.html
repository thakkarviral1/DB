    <b><u>FILM MAKING</u></b>
  </h2>
  <p style="margin: 10px; text-align: center;">
    Filmmaking (film production) is the process of making a film.
Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story or idea, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience known as film release. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, historical, philosophical , fictional and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques.
Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete.
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 10px;">
Film production consists of five major stages:
<ul>
<li>Development:</li>
<li>Pre-production</li>
<li>Production</li>
<li>Post-production</li>
<li>Distribution</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b><u>Development</u></b><br>
In this stage, the project producer selects a story, which may come from a book, play, another film, true story, video game, comic book, graphic novel, or an original idea or any other source. After identifying a theme, a synopsis is prepared. Next they produce a step outline, Then, they prepare a treatment. This usually has little dialogue and stage direction, but often contains drawings that help visualize key points. Another way is to produce a scriptment once a synopsis is produced.
Next, a screenwriter writes a screenplay. The screenwriter may rewrite it several times to improve dramatization, clarity, structure, characters, dialogue, and overall style. However, producers often skip the previous steps and develop submitted screenplays which investors, studios, and other interested parties assess through a process called script coverage.
A film distributor may be contacted at an early stage to assess the likely market and potential financial success of the film, the historical success of similar films, the actors who might appear in the film, and potential directors. All these factors imply a certain appeal of the film to a possible audience. Not all films make a profit from the theatrical release alone, so film companies take DVD sales and worldwide distribution rights into account.
Development of animated films differs slightly in that it is the director who develops and pitches a story to an executive producer on the basis of rough storyboards, and it is rare for a full-length screenplay to already exist at that point in time. If the film is green-lighted for further development and pre-production, then a screenwriter is later brought in to prepare the screenplay.
Pre-production

In pre-production, every step of actually creating the film is carefully designed and planned. The production company is created and a production office established. The film is pre-visualized by the director, and may be storyboarded with the help of illustrators and concept artists. A production budget is drawn up to plan expenditures for the film. For major productions, insurance is procured to protect against accidents.
</p>
<br>
<p style="margin: 10px;">
The nature of the film, and the budget, determine the size and type of crew used during filmmaking.:
<ul>
<li>Storyboard artist</li>
<li>Director</li>
<li>Assistant director</li>
<li>Film producer</li>
<li>Unit production manager</li>
<li>Location manager</li>
<li>Production designer</li>
<li>Art Director</li>
<li>Costume designer</li>
<li>Casting director</li>
<li>Choreographer</li>
<li>fight choreographer</li>
<li>Director of photography</li>
<li>Cinematographers</li>
<li>Camera Operators</li>
<li>Production Sound Mixer</li>
<li>Boom Operator, Director, DA, DP, and First AD</li>
<li>Sound designer</li>
<li>sound editor- director of audiography</li>
<li>Composer</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b><u>Production</u></b><br>

In production, the video production/film is created and shot. More crew is recruited at this stage, such as the property master, script supervisor, assistant directors, stills photographer, picture editor, and sound editors.
</p>
<br>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<b><u>Post-production</u></b><br>

Here the video/film is assembled by the video/film editor. The shot film material is edited. The production sound (dialogue) is also edited; music tracks and songs are composed and recorded if a film is sought to have a score; sound effects are designed and recorded. Any computer-graphic visual effects are digitally added.
Distribution

This is the final stage, where the film is released to cinemas or, occasionally, directly to consumer media (DVD, VCD, VHS, Blu-ray) or direct download from a digital media provider. The film is duplicated as required either onto film or hard disk drives and distributed to cinemas for screening. Press kits, posters, and other advertising materials are published, and the film is advertised and promoted.
Film distributors usually release a film with a launch party, a red-carpet premiere, press releases, interviews with the press, press preview screenings, and film festival screenings. Most films are also promoted with their own special website separate from those of the production company or distributor.

Film making is possibly the broadest and most varied creative opportunity in mass media. A blend of creativity and technicality, Films are an important media, not only for entertainment and information, but also for communication. It is inclusive of feature films, documentaries, Promotional films, TV commercials, music Videos, etc. The technique of filmmaking is a teamwork which needs close and coherent organization of various skilled individuals. It involves acting, directing, producing, script writing, cinematography, sound recording, visual mixing, editing and so on.
A film maker has to concentrate on all these concepts equally. He should be having that creative as well as technical knack for story ideas and unique implementation towards carrying out an appealing effect. His job demands a lot of work that is from ideas, story, script, cast, screenplay, music, direction, budget, sets, location… and the list is endless. He has to start at the very bottom and work his way up. i.e. beginning with raising capital for the film to its distribution, screening as well as all the stages of its crafting.
